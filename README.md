# Once you make changes
git add .
git commit -m "message related to the change you made"
git push
# If you want to get other people's code that they pushed to the repo
git pull
# If you want your code to be on a separate branch
git checkout -b [branch_name]

```

#### TODOS for today

- multiple documents
- different types of documents
- different vector databases (chroma, pinecone)
- different types of models to query (openAI, llama2)
- a frontend for user experience
